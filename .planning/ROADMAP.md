# Roadmap: Columba 0.7.2 Bug Fixes

## Overview

This milestone addresses two high-priority bugs reported after the 0.7.2 pre-release: performance degradation (#340) and relay auto-selection loop (#343). Each bug is addressed as a complete investigation-to-fix cycle within its own phase, allowing independent progress on either issue.

## Phases

**Phase Numbering:**
- Integer phases (1, 2, 3): Planned milestone work
- Decimal phases (2.1, 2.2): Urgent insertions (marked with INSERTED)

- [ ] **Phase 1: Performance Fix** - Investigate and fix UI stuttering and progressive degradation
- [ ] **Phase 2: Relay Loop Fix** - Investigate and fix the relay auto-selection loop

## Phase Details

### Phase 1: Performance Fix
**Goal**: App runs smoothly without progressive degradation, especially on Interface Discovery screen
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: PERF-01, PERF-02, PERF-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User can scroll Interface Discovery screen without visible stuttering or lag
  2. User can leave app running for extended periods (30+ minutes) without UI responsiveness degrading
  3. User can interact with buttons and UI elements with immediate (<200ms) response
  4. Memory usage remains stable over time (no unbounded growth visible in profiler)
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 01-01: TBD

### Phase 2: Relay Loop Fix
**Goal**: Relay auto-selection works correctly without add/remove cycling
**Depends on**: Nothing (independent of Phase 1)
**Requirements**: RELAY-01, RELAY-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User sees relay selected once and it stays selected (no repeated add/remove in logs)
  2. User can manually unset relay, and system re-selects a relay exactly once (not in a loop)
  3. Relay selection logs show clean single-selection behavior, not 40+ cycles
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 02-01: TBD

## Progress

**Execution Order:**
Phases 1 and 2 are independent and can be worked in any order.

| Phase | Plans Complete | Status | Completed |
|-------|----------------|--------|-----------|
| 1. Performance Fix | 0/TBD | Not started | - |
| 2. Relay Loop Fix | 0/TBD | Not started | - |
